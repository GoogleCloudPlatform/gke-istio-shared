# Files shared by the Istio demos

This repository contains all of the files shared by the Istio demos for
Kubernetes Engine.

## Istio Demos

This project demonstrates how to use an Istio service mesh in a single
Kubernetes Engine cluster alongside Prometheus, Jaeger, and Grafana, to monitor
cluster and workload performance metrics.  You will first deploy the Istio
control plane, data plane, and additional visibility tools using the provided
scripts, then explore the collected metrics and trace data in Grafana.

### GCE Demo

In this project, you will leverage Kubernetes Engine and Google Compute Engine
to explore how Istio can manage services that reside outside of the Kubernetes
Engine environment. You will deploy a typical Istio service mesh in Kubernetes
Engine, then configure an externally deployed microservice to join the mesh.
